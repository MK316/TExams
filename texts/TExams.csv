","In English, the past-tense morpheme is realized in three different phonetic forms. These are shown in the following words.

(1) grabbed [d] reaped [t] raided [d]
hugged [d] poked [t] gloated [d]

Also, the morpheme used to express indefiniteness has two phonetic forms—'an' before a word that begins with a vowel sound and 'a' before a word that begins with a consonant sound.

(2) first, an orange vs. a building; second, an accent vs. a car; third, an eel vs. a girl

Another case of this variation is found in pairs of words in (3). The final consonant in the first morpheme changes when a suffix is added. As a result, each of these morphemes has at least two different phonetic forms.

(3a) /t/ sound in permit vs. /s/ in permissive, (3b) /d/ in include vs. /s/ in inclusive,
(3c)/k/ sound in electric vs. /s/ sound in electricity, (3d) /s/ sound in impress vs. 'sh' sound in impression.

As exemplified in (1) to (3), a morpheme can have variant phonetic forms which are called ""blank"".",Fill in the blank with the ONE most appropriate word.
2024,2nd,"Read the passage in <A> and the examples in <B>, and follow the directions. [4 points]","When there are two or more feet in a word or phrase, in general, the rightmost foot gets a primary stress. Therefore, many English speakers would feel that ‘teen’ is stronger than ‘four’ in ‘fourteen.’ Another important tendency of English stress is that speech carries a regular alternation between stronger and weaker units. When ‘fourteen men’ is spoken in conversational style, the primary stress of ‘fourteen’ is adjusted. Since ‘men’ gets the primary stress of the whole phrase, ‘four’ is pronounced more strongly than ‘teen’ to avoid the clash of two lexical primary stresses.
(1) a. compact vs. compact disk.
b. thirteenth vs. thirteenth place.
c. good-looking vs. good-looking tutor.
d. academic vs. academic banter.

As exemplified in (1), the secondary and the primary stresses of a word are reversed when it is followed by another word. This is called ‘stress-shift’ or ‘rhythm reversal.’

(2) a. maroon vs. maroon sweater.
b. away vs. away game.
c. surrounding vs. surrounding crowd.
d. dependent vs. dependent clause.

<B>
a. maternal love.
b. economic growth.
c. unexplained symptom.
d. approved courses.
Note that the phonetic forms given in <B> are the pronunciations of the first words when they are produced in isolation.","Based on <A>, choose the TWO phrases where stress-shift can occur in <B>. Then, besides the given phonological condition for stress-shift underlined in <A>, state an additional phonological condition necessary for stress-shift."
2024,3rd,"Read the passage in <A> and the examples in <B>, and follow the directions. [4 points]","<A>
It is not unusual for a segment to appear repeatedly in a word. However, repeated segments in proximity are sometimes repaired by means of dissimilation, by which a segment becomes less similar to another segment. For example, -al suffix appears in the form of -ar to avoid the repetition of /l/ in the final syllable, when it attaches to stems ending with /l/ (e.g., annual, mental, coronal vs. angular, similar, velar).
Repeated segments are repaired by means of deletion as well as dissimilation. As is well known, most varieties of American English are rhotic, which means /r/ is retained in coda position as in (1).

(1) ranger [ˈreɪndʒər]
curtain [ˈkɜrtn]
labor [ˈleɪbər]
nursery [ˈnɜrsəri]

But in some of these varieties of American English, word-medial /r/ has been found to be deleted in the following words.

(2) a. corner [ˈkɔnə]
b. farmer [ˈfɑːmə]
c. Harvard [ˈhævəd]
d. cursor [ˈkɜrsə]

Not only word-medial /r/, but word-final /r/ is also deleted in the varieties. Take a look at the words in (3).

(3) a. terror [ˈterə]
b. mirror [ˈmɪrə]
c. bearer [ˈbeərə]
d. fairer [ˈferə]

<B>
a. horror
b. corridor
c. torture
d. proctor","In <B>, choose the TWO words in which /r/-deletion can occur as shown in <A>. Then state the phonological conditions under which word-medial /r/ is deleted in the varieties."
